# STAR WARS Frontend Project:

This is the frontend project of the Full Stack Web Development postgraduate course. The objective of the project is to use the knowledge learned in class about React to develop a React app that use an API to show some information. In my case I have decided to use [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), the Star Wars API to get **characters**, **films**, **species**, **starships**, **vehicles** and **planets**, and a **StarWars-VisualGuide API** to get their images.
